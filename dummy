1. Whether we need to write tests in python to test rust code ? If so, we need to check interface for python to rust

2. To write test code in rust we require to ramp up on the same

3. WRT LMDB, we wanted to test how validator behaves for the below scenarios, 
- Start time of validator, if LMDB data is too large (may be 50k transactiosn)
- Query response time of the validator,  if LMDB data is too large (may be 50k transactiosn)
- Delete LMDB and reinstall sawtooth
- Change group and permission of LMDB
- No LMDB files
- In multivalidaor also, we can check response time for too big LMDB, update of LMDB after brining node up, permission, reinstall sawtooth etc

4. Apart from rest api, Other exposed interfaces we need to investigate and also unit test we need to investigate
